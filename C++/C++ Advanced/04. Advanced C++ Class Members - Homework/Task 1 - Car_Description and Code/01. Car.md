# Task 1 – Car

You are given program in a **Car**** Main ****.cpp** file that reads and creates **const** objects of class **Car** , which has the following attributes:

- Brand ( **string** )

- Model ( **string** )

- Year ( **int** )

The program reads input and writes output to the console, using the Car class and getters for the above-mentioned attributes.

Your task is to study the code in **Car**** Main ****.cpp** and implement the **Car** class in **Car.h** (which is **#include** -d by **CarMain.cpp** ), so that **CarMain.cpp** compiles successfully and accomplishes the task described. Your **Car.h** file should resemble the following:

| **Car.h** |
| --- |
| #ifndefCAR\_H <br> #defineCAR\_H <br> // Place your code here  <br><br> #endif// !CAR\_H |

You should submit a single **.zip** file for this task, containing ONLY the **Car.h** file. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Volkswagen <br> Golf <br> 2015 | Brand -> Volkswagen <br> Model -> Golf <br> Year -> 2015 |
