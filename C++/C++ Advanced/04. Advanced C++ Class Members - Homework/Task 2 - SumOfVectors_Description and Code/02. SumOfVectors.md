Write C++ code for solving the tasks on the following pages.

Code should compile under the C++03 or the C++11 standard.

Submit your solutions here: https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/1183/04-Advanced-CPlusPlus-Class-Members-Homework (select &quot;Compete&quot; when prompted)

Any code files that are part of the task are provided under the folder **Skeleton**.

Please follow the exact instructions on uploading the solutions for each task.

# Task 2 – SumOfVectors

You are given program in a Main **.cpp** file that read:

1. How many couples of data you have
2. Elements data 1
3. Elements data 2

The number of couples is an integer, the datas are strings.

With the couples in the data vectors, you have to create a new vector with concatenation of the previous 2 vectors data.

Write a function that does the concatenation

Your task is to study the code in **Main.cpp** and implement the **SumOfVectors** function  in **SumOfVectors.h** (which is **#include** -d by **Main.cpp** ), so that **Main.cpp** compiles successfully and accomplishes the task described. Your SumOfVectors **.h** file should resemble the following:

| **SumOfVectors****.h** |
| --- |
| #ifndef SUMOFVECTORS\_H<br>#defineSUMOFVECTORS\_H<br><br>// Place your code here<br>#endif// !SUMOFVECTORS\_H |

You should submit a single **.zip** file for this task, containing ONLY the **SumOfVectors.h** file. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.
