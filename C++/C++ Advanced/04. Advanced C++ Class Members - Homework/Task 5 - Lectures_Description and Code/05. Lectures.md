# Task 5 – Lectures

You are given code similar to **Task 4 – Resources** , however this time the **main()** code uses a **Lecture** object (the class for which should be defined in a **Lecture.h** file) to store and organize the resources. It also uses several operators to do that, and iterates the Resources in the Lecture through a range-based for loop (_hint: the_ **_Lecture_** _class will need_ **_begin()_** _and_ **_end()_** _methods which return iterators_).

Another difference is that in this task, there can be two **Resource** objects in the input which have different **link** s, but have the same **id**. This indicates that the Resource has been changed – i.e. if a **Resource** with the same **id** is encountered **multiple times** , only keep its version appearing **latest** in the input.

The program&#39;s output should be the same as in **Task 4** – the resources ordered by **id** , followed by the number of occurrences of each **ResourceType** , ordered **Presentation** (if non-zero), then **Demos** (if non-zero) and last **Video** (if non-zero).

Your task is to study the code, figure out what operators and classes you need to implement, search the Web for concepts you aren&#39;t familiar with, and submit the files necessary for the program to compile and run successfully.

You should submit a single **.zip** file for this task, containing ONLY the files YOU created. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.
