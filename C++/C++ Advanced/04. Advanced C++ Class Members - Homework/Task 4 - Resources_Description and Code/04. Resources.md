# Task 4 – Resources

You are given code for a program which reads information about Resources (links to Presentations, Demos or Videos) in the SoftUni Learning system _(well, ok, not the real system, but at least this one won&#39;t break the links…)_ and then sorts them by their id, and also prints how many of each type of resource there was in the input.

Each **Resource** has the following properties:

- --An integer **id**
- --A **ResourceType** – one of **Presentation** , **Demo** , or **Video**
- --A **string** representing the link to the resource

The code for the program is in the **ResourcesMain.cpp** and it uses a **Resource** class, which it expects to be defined in a file named &quot; **Resource.h**&quot; in the same directory.

Your task is to study the **ResourcesMain.cpp** file and the **ResourceType.h** file, and to create the **Resource.h** file and implement the **Resource** class in such a way that the program correctly reads the input, orders it by id, prints it as lines on the output (each **Resource** output line should have the same format as the matching **Resource** input line) and then prints the number of Resources of each type.

Your **Resource.h** file should resemble the following:

| **Resource.h** |
| --- |
| #ifndef RESOURCE\_H#defineRESOURCE\_H #include&quot;ResourceType.h&quot; // Place your code here #endif// !RESOURCE\_H |

You should submit a single **.zip** file for this task, containing ONLY the **Resource.h** file. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.
