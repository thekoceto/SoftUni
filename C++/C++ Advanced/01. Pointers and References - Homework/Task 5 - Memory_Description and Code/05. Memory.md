# Task 5 – Memory

You are given program in an **MemoryMain.cpp** , as well as a **Company.h** file, that read information about **companies** and writes it to the console.

Each company has:

- An **id** (an integer between **0** and **255** )
- A **name** (a **string** containing a sequence of lowercase English letters **a-z** )
-  **Employees** by their initials (a **vector** of **pair** s of characters, containing at most **255** employee initials)

The MemoryMain.cpp file reads the information from the console, as a sequence of byte values, stores those bytes in memory (RAM), and then calls a function named **readCompaniesFromMemory** , passing it two parameters:

- a **pointer** to the **first byte** in the memory containing the companies
- an integer indicating the **number of companies** stored in the memory

The memory format of each company is the following:

- the first byte contains the **id** of the company ( **0-255** )
- the **name** of the company starts from the second byte and ends with a null terminator (the value **0** , or **&#39;\0&#39;** ), i.e. the name of the company is placed in memory the same way a null-terminated C-String would be
- the next byte contains the number of employees the company has ( **0-255** ). Let&#39;s call it **numEmployees**
- the following **numEmployees \* 2** bytes contain pairs of initials of the employees, i.e. if the **numEmployees** byte is at address **x** , then the **first employee&#39;s first initial** is at address **x + 1** , their **second initial** is at address **x + 2** , the **second employee&#39;s first initial** is at address **x + 3** and their **second** is at address **x + 4** and so on.

The **MemoryMain.cpp** file will print the companies in the format:

- company **id** , space, company **name** , space, opening bracket **&#39;(&#39;**, first initial of first employee, dot **&#39;.&#39;** , second initial of first employee, dot **&#39;.&#39;** , first initial of second employee, … , closing bracket **&#39;)&#39;**

For example, if we have the companies:

-  **id = 42, name = &quot;uni&quot;, employees = { {&#39;I&#39;, &#39;K&#39;}, {&#39;S&#39;, &#39;N&#39;} }** and
**id = 13, name = &quot;joro&quot;, employees = { {&#39;G&#39;, &#39;G&#39; } }**

Their representation as **string** s printed by **MemoryMain.cpp** will be:

**42 uni (I.K.,S.N.)
13 joro (G.G.)**

Their representation in memory, assuming the memory starts at byte address **M**** ,** will be:

| **Offset from start** | **0** | **+1** | **+2** | **+3** | **+4** | **+5** | **+6** | **+7** | **+8** | **+9** | **+10** | **+11** | **+12** | **+13** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **42** | **&#39;u&#39;** | **&#39;n&#39;** | **&#39;i&#39;** | **&#39;\0&#39;** | **2** | **&#39;I&#39;** | **&#39;K&#39;** | **&#39;S&#39;** | **&#39;N&#39;** | **13** | **&#39;j&#39;** | **&#39;o&#39;** | **&#39;r&#39;** |

| **Offset from start** | **+14** | **+15** | **+16** | **+17** | **+18** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **&#39;o&#39;** | **&#39;\0&#39;** | **1** | **&#39;G&#39;** | **&#39;G&#39;** |

And their representation in the input for the task will be:

**42 117 110 105 0 2 73 75 83 78**

**13 106 111 114 111 0 1 71 71**

**end**

Your task is to create a file called **CompanyMemoryUtils.h** (which **MemoryMain.cpp** includes), containing the function **readCompaniesFromMemory** , implemented in such a way that MemoryMain.cpp compiles successfully and works as described above – i.e. your task is to read the memory, which will be in the format described above, and return a **vector\&lt;Company\&gt;** containing the companies that were written in that memory.

You should submit a single **.zip** file for this task, containing ONLY the **CompanyMemoryUtils****.h **file. The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them along with your** CompanyMemoryUtils ****.h** file in the same directory.

NOTE: you are also given the code for the test generator used to generate the tests in the judge system, in C#. Compiling and running it will produce random tests ( **.in.txt** input files and **.out.txt** output files) similar to those in the Judge system, which you can use to test your code locally.
