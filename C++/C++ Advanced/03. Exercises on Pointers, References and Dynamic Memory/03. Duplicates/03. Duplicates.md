# Task 3 – Duplicates

You are given code that reads information about companies – each having a **name** and a **list of employees by their initials** – and removes duplicate companies (companies with the same name are considered duplicates). The given code accomplishes this by using a function named **removeDuplicates** , which accepts a single parameter – a **list** of **Company\***.

Note that the list of pointers may contain multiple pointers pointing to the same **Company** object, as well as pointers pointing to different objects, which have the same name. The function should remove any duplicates but leave their first occurrence in the list (i.e. the first time a **Company** is found in the list, it is considered the &quot;original&quot; and all subsequent Companies with the same name are considered duplicates).

Also note that you should ensure that removed duplicates are cleared from memory, using the **delete** keyword.

You should submit a single **.zip** file for this task, containing ONLY the **RemoveDuplicates.h** file, containing an **int main()** function that solves the task described.

| **RemoveDuplicates.h** |
| --- |
| #ifndefREMOVE\_DUPLICATES\_H <br> #defineREMOVE\_DUPLICATES\_H <br>#include&quot;Company.h&quot; <br>// Place your code here <br>#endif// !REMOVE\_DUPLICATES\_H |

The Judge system has a copy of the other files and will compile them, along with your file, in the same directory.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| uni (I.K.,S.N.)<br>\*begin<br>\*end<br>\*begin<br>joro (G.G.)<br>\*begin<br>\*begin<br>end | joro (G.G.)<br>uni (I.K.,S.N.) | The \*begin line means insert a pointer to the last company at the start of the list. The \*end line means insert such a pointer at the end of the list. Hence, after reading the input, the program will have the following list (\* denotes an object inserted as a copied pointer):<br>\*joro (G.G.)<br>\*joro (G.G.)<br>\*uni (I.K.,S.N.)<br>\*uni (I.K.,S.N.)<br>uni (I.K.,S.N.)<br>\*uni (I.K.,S.N.)<br>joro (G.G.)<br> In this list, the joro company is followed by the uni company, even though it is created later – that&#39;s due to the inserting of the \*begin pointers after creating the joro company. Hence joro will appear first in the output, and uni second, because the first pointer to joro in the list is before the first pointer to uni in the list. <br> The idea behind this unusual input is that your code for the removeDuplicates function should not assume anything about the input – just traverse the list and remove the duplicates, don&#39;t attempt to figure out a way to cheat the input |
